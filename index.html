            <p>Washington ‚Äî In a bipartisan effort that marks a significant shift in technology policy, Congress unveiled legislation on Tuesday that would impose strict regulations on artificial intelligence systems, requiring companies to assess potential harms before deploying new AI tools and establishing an oversight board with enforcement powers.</p>

            <p>The proposed AI Accountability Act comes after months of contentious hearings in which tech executives, researchers, and civil rights advocates testified about the rapidly evolving capabilities of AI systems and their potential to disrupt labor markets, spread misinformation, and perpetuate discrimination.</p>

            <p>"For too long, we have allowed the technology sector to operate in a regulatory vacuum," said Senator Maria Rodriguez, D-Calif., one of the bill's primary sponsors. "The genie is out of the bottle with artificial intelligence, but we still have time to ensure these powerful tools are developed responsibly and in the public interest."</p>

            <p>The legislation would require companies developing advanced AI systems to conduct impact assessments before releasing products to the public, evaluating potential effects on employment, civil rights, national security, and information integrity. It would also create a new federal agency, the AI Safety Commission, with the authority to investigate violations and levy fines up to 4 percent of a company's global revenue.</p>

            <p>Major technology companies responded cautiously to the proposal. In a joint statement, representatives from Google, Microsoft, and Meta said they supported "sensible guardrails" but warned that overly restrictive regulations could hamper American innovation and cede leadership in AI development to countries with fewer protections.</p>

            <p>"We share lawmakers' concerns about AI safety and believe responsible development is paramount," the statement read. "However, we urge Congress to craft legislation that protects consumers without stifling the research and development that keeps America at the forefront of this critical technology."</p>

            <p>Critics from both industry and civil liberties groups have questioned whether the proposed regulations go far enough. The Electronic Frontier Foundation argued that the bill lacks sufficient protections for privacy and free speech, while some venture capitalists warned that compliance costs could make it virtually impossible for startups to compete with established players.</p>

            <p>The debate arrives as AI systems become increasingly integrated into daily life, from chatbots that handle customer service inquiries to algorithms that influence hiring decisions and loan applications. Recent studies have shown that some AI tools exhibit biases that disadvantage women and minorities, while the rise of deepfake technology has raised alarms about election security and fraud.</p>

            <p>Public opinion has shifted dramatically in recent months. A poll conducted last month by the Pew Research Center found that 72 percent of Americans support government regulation of AI, up from 58 percent a year ago. Concerns about job losses appeared particularly acute, with 64 percent of respondents saying they worried AI would eliminate more jobs than it creates.</p>

            <p>The legislation faces an uncertain path forward. While it has attracted bipartisan support in the Senate, House Republicans have signaled reluctance to embrace what they characterize as regulatory overreach. The bill's fate may ultimately depend on whether lawmakers can find common ground before the election season fully takes hold.</p>

            <p>For now, technology companies are preparing for a new era of scrutiny. Several major firms have already established AI ethics boards and expanded their policy teams in Washington. Whether through legislation or self-regulation, the days of AI development proceeding unfettered appear to be drawing to a close.</p>
